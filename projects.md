#### NetSuite inventory implementation for Zeus Living

- **Role:** Lead Warehouse Manager & ERP Data Migration Specialist  
- **Timeline:** Nov 2019 – 2020

##### Business context
- **Starting point:** Inventory managed via Google Sheets and Zenventory worksheets, with poor tracking and no inventory integrity.
- **Constraints:** Migration occurred while physical inventory was moving and POs were active; business could not pause.
- **Adoption:** Securing cross‑functional buy‑in for NetSuite ERP was a major hurdle.

##### Objectives
- **Seamless migration:** Move Zenventory data into NetSuite ERP while operations continued.
- **Data architecture:** Establish clean, logical SKU, bin, and location structures for long‑term integrity.
- **Partner alignment:** Collaborate with Jade Global to fit configuration to real operations.
- **Training:** Enable both frontline staff and directors on new workflows.
- **Continuity:** Build the foundation for ongoing optimization post–go‑live.

##### Key actions
- **SKU conventions:** Designed standardized naming across all inventory items.
- **Bin/location design:** Built hierarchies in NetSuite aligned to warehouse reality.
- **Partner integration:** Worked with Jade Global to configure inventory features for accuracy and usability.
- **Data validation:** Reconciled migrated records with physical counts during live operations.
- **Training delivery:** Created and led sessions for warehouse teams and leadership.
- **Zero‑downtime plan:** Coordinated live PO processing and movements during cutover.

##### Tools & techniques
- **Platform:** NetSuite ERP (Inventory Management, workflows, saved searches, reporting).
- **Data sources:** Historical Zenventory exports, archived Google Sheets, and prior POs.
- **Migration method:** Segmented approach—cycle‑count and validate one warehouse at a time, then move to NetSuite.
- **Reconciliation:** Physical‑to‑system checks to maintain accuracy during concurrent moves.
- **Enablement:** End‑user documentation and workflow guides for multiple audiences.

##### Impact
- **Go‑live achieved:** Fully transitioned from Zenventory/spreadsheets to NetSuite ERP within the first year across all warehouses.
- **Operational continuity:** Maintained business operations during migration with no shutdowns.
- **Data foundation:** “Clean‑enough” dataset enabled immediate use and future clean‑up projects.
- **Sustained ownership:** Continued as primary NetSuite/inventory contact, iterating on customizations and adoption.
