    <h1>NetSuite Inventory Implementation for Zeus Living</h1>

    <h3>Role</h3>
    <p>Lead Warehouse Manager &amp; ERP Data Migration Specialist</p>

    <h3>Timeline</h3>
    <p>Nov 2019 – 2020</p>

    <h2>Business context</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Starting point:</strong> Inventory managed via Google Sheets and Zenventory worksheets, with poor tracking and no inventory integrity.</li>
      <li><strong>Constraints:</strong> Migration occurred while physical inventory was moving and POs were active; business could not pause.</li>
      <li><strong>Adoption:</strong> Securing cross‑functional buy‑in for NetSuite ERP was a major hurdle.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Seamless migration:</strong> Move Zenventory data into NetSuite ERP while operations continued.</li>
      <li><strong>Data architecture:</strong> Establish clean, logical SKU, bin, and location structures for long‑term integrity.</li>
      <li><strong>Partner alignment:</strong> Collaborate with Jade Global to fit configuration to real operations.</li>
      <li><strong>Training:</strong> Enable both frontline staff and directors on new workflows.</li>
      <li><strong>Continuity:</strong> Build the foundation for ongoing optimization post–go‑live.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key actions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>SKU conventions:</strong> Designed standardized naming across all inventory items.</li>
      <li><strong>Bin/location design:</strong> Built hierarchies in NetSuite aligned to warehouse reality.</li>
      <li><strong>Partner integration:</strong> Worked with Jade Global to configure inventory features for accuracy and usability.</li>
      <li><strong>Data validation:</strong> Reconciled migrated records with physical counts during live operations.</li>
      <li><strong>Training delivery:</strong> Created and led sessions for warehouse teams and leadership.</li>
      <li><strong>Zero‑downtime plan:</strong> Coordinated live PO processing and movements during cutover.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tools &amp; techniques</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Platform:</strong> NetSuite ERP (Inventory Management, workflows, saved searches, reporting).</li>
      <li><strong>Data sources:</strong> Historical Zenventory exports, archived Google Sheets, and prior POs.</li>
      <li><strong>Migration method:</strong> Segmented approach—cycle‑count and validate one warehouse at a time, then move to NetSuite.</li>
      <li><strong>Reconciliation:</strong> Physical‑to‑system checks to maintain accuracy during concurrent moves.</li>
      <li><strong>Enablement:</strong> End‑user documentation and workflow guides for multiple audiences.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Impact</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Go‑live achieved:</strong> Fully transitioned from Zenventory/spreadsheets to NetSuite ERP within the first year across all warehouses.</li>
      <li><strong>Operational continuity:</strong> Maintained business operations during migration with no shutdowns.</li>
      <li><strong>Data foundation:</strong> “Clean‑enough” dataset enabled immediate use and future clean‑up projects.</li>
      <li><strong>Sustained ownership:</strong> Continued as primary NetSuite/inventory contact, iterating on customizations and adoption.</li>
    </ul>
